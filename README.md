Weather-Updates is a modern full-stack weather application built using Next.js.  
The application fetches real-time weather data through secure server-side API routes and displays it in a clean and responsive interface.

## 📌 About The Project

This project was developed to understand:

- Next.js App Router architecture
- API Routes in Next.js
- Server-side data handling
- Environment variable security
- Full-stack deployment using Vercel

Instead of exposing the weather API key on the frontend, requests are handled securely through Next.js backend routes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- CSS / Tailwind (if used)
- Server-side API routes
- External Weather API

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters city name
2. Frontend sends request to `/api/weather`
3. Next.js API route fetches data from external Weather API
4. Data is processed server-side
5. JSON response sent back to frontend
6. UI updates dynamically
